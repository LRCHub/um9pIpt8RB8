[00:17.15] Pushing through the market square
[00:22.26] So many mothers sighing
[00:27.02] News had just come over
[00:30.32] We had five years left to cry in
[00:46.32] 
[00:36.43] News guy wept and told us
[00:40.21] Earth was really dying
[00:45.77] Cried so much his face was wet
[01:00.77] 
[00:49.32] Then I knew he was not lying
[01:03.32] 
[00:54.23] I heard telephones
[00:55.93] Opera house
[00:57.08] Favorite melodies
[00:58.75] I saw boys
[01:00.39] Toys
[01:01.44] Electric irons and TV's
[01:03.69] My brain hurt like a warehouse
[01:18.69] 
[01:05.97] It had no room to spare
[01:08.18] I had to cram so many things
[01:22.18] 
[01:10.08] To store everything in there
[01:12.41] And all the fat, skinny people
[01:16.43] And all the tall, short people
[01:31.43] 
[01:20.97] And all the nobody people
[01:25.86] And all the somebody people
[01:28.86] Never thought I'd need so many people
[01:47.36] 
[01:37.21] A girl my age went off her head
[01:41.94] Hit some tiny children
[01:46.32] If the black hadn't a-pulled her off
[01:50.17] I think she would have killed them
[02:07.17] 
[01:55.71] A soldier with a broken arm
[01:59.65] Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
[02:05.18] A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
[02:08.83] And the queer threw up at the sight of that
[02:30.33] 
[02:14.59] I think I saw you in an ice cream parlor
[02:19.05] Drinking milk shakes cold and long
[02:22.76] Smiling and waving and looking so fine
[02:27.81] Don't think you knew you were in this song
[02:31.68] And it was cold and it rained
[02:34.17] So I felt like an actor
[02:36.59] And I thought of ma
[02:38.62] And I wanted to get back there
[02:41.30] Your face
[02:42.43] Your race
[02:43.59] The way that you talk
[02:45.66] I kiss you
[02:47.02] You're beautiful
[02:48.03] I want you to walk
[02:50.15] We've got five years
[02:52.90] Stuck on my eyes
[02:55.31] Five years
[02:57.44] What a surprise
[02:59.20] We've got five years
[03:02.14] My brain hurts a lot
[03:04.62] Five years
[03:06.57] That's all we've got
[03:08.41] We've got five years
[03:11.13] What a surprise
[03:13.62] Five years
[03:15.63] Stuck on my eyes
[03:17.51] We've got five years
[03:19.94] My brain hurts a lot
[03:22.48] Five years
[03:24.60] That's all we've got
[03:26.38] We've got five years
[03:29.58] Stuck on my eyes
[03:31.65] Five years
[03:33.74] What a surprise
[03:35.39] We've got five years
[03:37.84] My brain hurts a lot
[03:40.71] Five years,
